Note:  
   Output is worth 40 points.
   Each of these is worth 8 points of output.
   You should also supply one program of your own for another 8 points.
   We will also run other programs for the remaining 8 points.
   These three cover all instructions except for AddX and SubX, so be sure to test those.


sample1.txt 
   Exercises the load indirect instructions.
   Prints two tables, one of A-Z, the other of 1-10.

sample2.txt
   Exercises the call/ret instructions.
   Prints a face where the lines are printed using subroutine calls.

sample3.txt and inter.txt
   Exercises the int/iret instructions.
